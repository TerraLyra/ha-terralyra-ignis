# Changelog

## 0.27.1

- Expose source retrieval health alongside active, combined, FIRMS and raw-pixel counts. Partial source availability is visible without changing count values, identifiers or persisted history. Successful retrieval does not certify observation completeness.
- Cover full → partial → recovered source responses after restart, including preserved incident history. The cause of the historical counter discontinuity (#41) remains unproven.
- Document the HA camera test dependency and refresh provider-request status; no additional official provider is enabled.

## 0.27.0

- Add opt-in NIFC / WFIGS official US reports: source-status sensor, timed calendar and location-aware map. Reports remain separate from satellite detections.
- Require explicit administrator first-use initialization; share bounded retrieval, persistent cooldowns and review/recovery diagnostics across consumers.
- Preserve existing incident history, identifiers and configuration. NIFC storage is separate; reports do not create satellite alerts or imply an all-clear.
- Prepare a standalone observation-model packaging pilot with HA compatibility checks; no external package or Cloud account is required.
- Update repository links and CI tooling. ACT and Victoria remain offline research only, without production entities or calendars.

See [0.27.0 release notes](docs/RELEASE_0_27_0.md) and [NIFC setup](docs/NIFC_USAGE.md).

## 0.26.5

- Distinguish retrieval success from source snapshot freshness in per-location source details.
- Preserve existing status values, thresholds, identifiers and history handling.
- Document cached responses, old observations and empty-result limitations.

## 0.26.4

- First stable release from `TerraLyra/ha-terralyra-ignis`, with source provenance preserved.
- Extract basic geographic/location helpers and HA attribute serialization behind compatibility-preserving interfaces.
- Preserve the integration domain, existing identifiers, storage keys and history format.
- Document the ordered HACS repository switch and rollback.

## 0.26.3

- Prevent replayed older observations from creating duplicate retained track IDs
  and repeated new-incident events outside the matching window.
- Count unique source track IDs and avoid multiplying corroboration counts from
  duplicate records. Preserve stored history.

## 0.26.2

- Track minimum distance per monitored location and use the selected location
  for both current and historical minimum distances, including merged incidents.
- Preserve legacy Home-based history without reinterpreting it. Scoped minima
  begin with observed samples and reset when reference coordinates change.

## 0.26.1 (prerelease)

- Show NSW RFS reports at their update time when the UTC publication field agrees
  with the Sydney-local UPDATED field. Use a one-minute display slot, not fire
  duration, and retain all-day fallback for uncertain timestamps.
- Preserve report identities and history; verify standard/daylight-saving offsets
  and calendar query boundaries.

## 0.26.0 (prerelease)

- Add a disabled-by-default Queensland QFD report calendar with a shared,
  bounded conditional-cache client and worker-based geometry/rendering. Keep
  incidents, warnings, planned burns and source-time uncertainty explicit; no
  satellite matching, warning events or persistent QFD archive is introduced.
- Add immutable official-report models, a compatibility-preserving NSW conversion
  and a mixed QFD parser. Preserve source identities, separate event/publication/
  expiry times and disclose filtered, invalid and conflicting records.
- Validate warning polygon topology with Shapely 2.1.2 and use bounded spherical
  circle intersection. Unsupported geometry and ambiguous boundaries stay unknown.
  Geometry tests pass on Linux ARM64 and x86-64; live HA checks remain pending.
- Refresh next-update sensor states at their estimated deadline using local timers,
  without extra provider requests. Preserve source selection and estimate labels.
- Show only in-radius locations in map entities' `location_matches`; expose all
  comparisons separately as `location_comparisons`. Event/history serialization,
  internal matching and alerts are unchanged.
- Document the Australia-first roadmap, source evidence and outstanding checks.

## 0.25.0

- Add an opt-in NSW RFS fire-report calendar using the official GeoJSON feed.
  Filter publisher points against enabled monitored-location radii; overlapping
  locations share one incident entry. Keep publisher report dates and labels,
  exclude explicitly planned/non-fire reports and unmapped LGA placeholders.
- Share a bounded 30-minute feed cache, parse outside the event loop, and mark
  retained snapshots stale during failures. No satellite matching, public-alert
  automation, or persistent NSW archive is introduced.

## 0.24.12

- Shortlist persistent tracking matches with Earth-centred spatial cells,
  preserving nearest-match tie order and one-match-per-snapshot semantics.
- Add multi-cycle randomized equivalence tests (poles, date line and delayed
  observations), a 2400-track comparison-count regression and a zero-radius tie
  test. This reduces candidate-search work; tracking still runs on the HA loop.

## 0.24.11

- Shortlist incident-family candidates using Earth-centred spatial cells while
  retaining existing temporal, diameter, ordering, and stable-ID rules.
- Run both family consolidation passes in the HA executor on private copies,
  preventing workers from mutating live coordinator state.
- Add randomized equivalence tests including poles and the date line, a bounded
  comparison-count regression, and an event-loop responsiveness test.
- All 745 tests pass locally. A synthetic 2400-track benchmark returned identical
  results in 0.078 s versus 4.922 s; deployed performance still needs verification.

## 0.24.10

- Add bounded, per-stage processing timings to downloaded diagnostics, including
  elapsed time and coordinator-thread CPU time for eleven stages.
- Retain the last completed processing run across unchanged-product skips.
- Document asynchronous-wait and CPU-attribution limits; these measurements do
  not by themselves prove continuous event-loop blocking.
- Diagnostic release only: no changes to detection, alerts, or polling behavior.
- All 740 tests pass locally.

## 0.24.9

- Distinguish unavailable forecast dates from service failures using the Risk
  layer's bounded, safely parsed WMS date catalogue after a non-future 404.
- Show localized missing-date notices and safe error summaries instead of raw
  upstream XML; retain automatic retry and self-clearing recovery notices.
- Never substitute an old forecast for today's data; satellite fire monitoring
  remains independent. This fix does not restore missing upstream forecasts.
- Bound forecast retry calculation before exponentiation for prolonged outages.
- Add date-catalogue and coordinator regressions; 740 tests pass locally.

## 0.24.8

- Fix GOES temporary-file cleanup accepting Home Assistant executor Futures,
  preventing a cleanup TypeError from masking a successful product or its error.
- Exercise both coroutine and Future executors for success, invalid downloads,
  decoder failures and cancellation; verify cleanup completes on cancellation.

## 0.24.7

- Classify unexpected provider exceptions with allowlisted diagnostic codes,
  without exposing exception messages, class names, paths or credentials.
- Test fallback diagnostics, healthy peers, retry retention and recovery.
- Diagnostic extension only; the deployed GOES root cause is not yet confirmed.

## 0.24.6

- Expose allowlisted GOES failure-stage codes in source health and integration
  diagnostics without raw exception text, native paths or credentials.
- Preserve diagnostic codes during deferred retries and clear them on recovery.
- Include diagnostic changes in product identity checks so source details refresh.
- This is a diagnostic release, not a confirmed fix for the deployed GOES failure.

## 0.24.5

- Publish location-specific approaching events with bounded, persisted trend
  samples and per-location cooldowns; align map distance and distance trend.
- Separate historical family membership and peak power from current power,
  position and independent-source confirmation.
- Reprocess corrected observations even when product timestamps and counts
  are unchanged; regroup retained pixels after obsolete scan filtering.
- Add regressions including coordinator-level opposite-motion event replays.

## 0.24.4

- Count distinct source observations by acquisition time with a bounded,
  persisted six-hour ledger, instead of summing repeated snapshot sizes.
- Exclude future records from activity windows and age observation counts on
  unchanged-product refreshes. Keep FRP and incident history separate.
- Expose collection-window and retention-limit metadata. Legacy aggregate
  counts are not converted; existing Recorder history remains untouched.

## 0.24.3

- Derive per-location latest product/receipt timestamps only from sources
  assigned to that location, rather than the global coordinator timestamp.
- Expose bounded source health, failure reasons and successful timestamps on
  each location's observation sensor for investigating empty maps.

## 0.24.2

- Preserve distance from the nearest matching monitored location when merging
  fire incidents for the map, instead of resetting it to Home distance. Overlap
  selection agrees with the location name and distance in entity attributes.

## 0.24.1

- Bound current fire clustering to a 30-minute acquisition window. Older
  overlapping passes no longer create duplicate current markers or independent
  confirmation. The tracking layer retains history already observed over time.
- Calculate FRP from the newest scan (with a one-minute scan-line tolerance)
  per provider/satellite/product, taking the largest view total. Preserve sums
  of adjacent pixels while avoiding repeated-pass and MTG/IODC view sums.
- Saturate provider retry delays before timedelta multiplication, preventing
  overflow during prolonged outages.

## 0.24.0

- Add a location-scoped active-fire observation sensor that distinguishes
  current detections, an observation with no active detections, reduced source
  coverage, startup and complete data unavailability. Its stable reason codes
  expose delayed, unavailable and initializing sources without treating an
  empty map as an all-clear.
- Align per-location active incident counts with the markers actually shown on
  the map by excluding inactive and ended tracks from the active summary.

## 0.23.0

- Add one map entity for every enabled monitored location. Its native Home
  Assistant map decoration shows the configured active-fire radius as a circle,
  in metres internally and kilometres in the readable attributes.
- Publish monitoring areas under the separate
  `terralyra_ignis_monitoring_areas` geolocation source, so existing fire maps
  remain unchanged and users can independently show or hide the circles.
- Remove stale area entities when a location is deleted or disabled. These
  circles describe configured monitoring boundaries only; they are not fire
  extents, satellite footprints, positioning uncertainty, or safety zones.

## 0.22.0

- Add an isolated, tested GDACS wildfire-context parser with bounded page sizes,
  stable event identifiers and explicit raw-time/centroid uncertainty. This is
  context code only: no changes to satellite evidence.
- Prepare a shared on-demand GDACS client and separate bounded archive: hourly
  cache, serialized requests, bounded pagination/payloads, failure backoff and
  preservation of previous records when a fetch is incomplete.
- Add a disabled-by-default GDACS context calendar with all-day provider dates,
  source attribution, stale-feed labels and conservative affected-area bounding
  box filtering. Missing/unsupported geometry is explicitly uncertain. Geometry
  requests are capped; this is not complete coverage or exact polygon matching.
  Existing installations do not poll GDACS until the calendar is enabled.

- Make reviewed calendar links easier to read: show the archived report title and
  BM OKF source first, explain the possible association, and format observation
  and review times in the Home Assistant time zone with explicit UTC offsets.
  Keep technical link/incident identifiers in the review/list actions rather than
  calendar descriptions. Existing saved links require no migration; matching,
  incident times and satellite evidence remain unchanged.

## 0.21.0

- Enrich official-report review candidates with coordinates, actual first/last
  detection times, providers, satellites and a per-candidate review token.
- Add explicit, reversible manual report links in a separate bounded local
  store. Saving rechecks one candidate and its token; changed reviews are rejected.
  Links are entry-scoped, survive restarts, and expire within 30 days of publication.
- Show active manually reviewed links in both calendars with source attribution
  and a clear non-confirmation label. Missing or revised reports and reused incident
  identities are not displayed as active links. Satellite evidence, counts, event
  identities and notifications remain unchanged.

## 0.20.1

- Filter the BM OKF publication calendar using bounded, local Hungarian fire-
  incident language rules. Hide weather alerts, non-fire accidents and uncertain
  notices without deleting archived records. Preserve explicitly described fires,
  including the saved Egyek report; no incident evidence or matching changes.

## 0.20.0

- Retain fetched BM OKF publications locally across restarts for 30 days, capped
  at 1000 URLs. Calendar and manual matching can use archived notices even after
  they leave RSS; live feed health and manual-import provenance remain explicit.
- Add a validated manual publication import action and an attributed, opt-in
  Egyek example. Regression tests replay the saved report against two reviewed
  satellite history samples without mutating incidents or auto-applying date hints.

## 0.19.0

- Add a response-only official-report review action that compares a selected
  current RSS notice with local incident history using explicitly reviewed fire
  coordinates, uncertainty and optional event times. It reports candidates and
  reasons without modifying incidents or applying extracted date hints.

- Preserve bounded RSS descriptions with attribution and expose review-only
  Hungarian previous-day ignition date hints. Dates use the publication's
  Europe/Budapest calendar day, retain source wording and do not become automatic
  incident start/end times or satellite associations.

- Add a disabled-by-default BM OKF publication calendar, separate from satellite
  incident history. When enabled, it refreshes every 15 minutes using the manual
  action's shared cache and includes attributed links and explicit publication-
  time and coverage limitations. No automatic incident matching is performed.

## 0.18.0

- Add an on-demand `get_official_reports` action returning current BM OKF
  emergency-notice titles, attributed links and publication times. Five-minute
  caching and failure cooldown bound requests. No automatic incident matching,
  background polling or new map markers are enabled.

- Add a local report-association foundation with explicit spatial and temporal
  uncertainty and shared-origin grouping. Automatic incident association and
  map/calendar presentation are not enabled yet.

## 0.17.1

- Remove inactive and ended incidents from the active-fire map while retaining
  their incident history; show reactivated incidents again after new observations.

## 0.17.0

- Consolidate nearby, temporally related provider tracks into stable physical
  incident families before publishing map entities, counts, history or events.
- Keep provider-level source tracks for attribution while exposing one incident
  identity with bounded source-track and spatial-extent diagnostics.
- Prevent duplicate new-fire and trend events for one incident, avoid summing
  overlapping-source intensity, and preserve the original entity identity when
  an incident gains a source or later splits.
- Document a separate, opt-in official-report and news-context roadmap that
  never treats automatically matched reporting as satellite or official proof.

## 0.16.0

- Add a local, searchable Home Assistant fire-incident history calendar. It
  retains up to 30 days or 500 incidents independently of the shorter map
  marker window and records first/last detection, monitored locations,
  coordinates, sources, satellites, peak FRP and detection counts.
- Build the archive entirely from the existing bounded provider refreshes, so
  the feature adds no upstream API calls and no additional live map markers.
- Keep credential-free NOAA GOES outages visible in source-health sensors and
  diagnostics without repeatedly recreating a non-actionable Repair issue.

## 0.15.4

- Reduce Home Assistant load by reusing unchanged active-fire products, avoiding
  unnecessary incident-store writes, and exposing bounded refresh performance
  counters in integration diagnostics.
- Record the worldwide fire-risk provider decision: JRC GWIS is the preferred
  global FWI candidate, subject to bounded live-WMS validation, while
  Open-Meteo remains a possible input for a separately validated calculated
  FWI provider.
- Add a provider-neutral per-location fire-risk coverage planner that assigns
  FRMv3 by geography instead of location identity and represents unvalidated
  GWIS coverage only as an inactive opportunity.
- Add privacy-safe diagnostics and regression coverage for covered, partially
  covered and uncovered monitored-location sets.

## 0.15.3

- Organize entity display names into localized `Location`, `Overview` and
  `Sources` groups so their scope is visible before the metric in alphabetical
  Home Assistant lists.
- Identify all FRMv3 fire-risk, forecast-map, calendar, selector, radius,
  risk-event and optional land-surface-temperature entities as Home-bound.
- Identify active-fire situation, incident, trend and history entities as a
  combined overview of all enabled monitored locations.
- Keep provider-specific NASA FIRMS counts, raw fire pixels and the redundant
  legacy all-source cluster alias as diagnostics disabled by default for new
  installations. Existing entities remain available and retain their IDs.
- Give the primary active-fire radius a dynamic location-name prefix and add
  translation regression coverage for the complete naming taxonomy.

## 0.15.2

- Group all per-location entities alphabetically with a localized
  `Location: <name> — <sensor>` display-name convention.
- Preserve existing entity identities, history, dashboards and automations;
  only the integration-provided display names change.

## 0.15.1

- Distinguish fully fresh per-location monitoring from usable but delayed
  equal-peer sources with a translated `degraded` state, instead of reporting
  misleadingly that every source is available.
- Expose per-source product, receipt and retry timestamps plus failure details
  in each monitored location's source-health attributes.
- Add automation-friendly fresh, delayed, unavailable and initializing source
  counts, provider lists and exact status groups.
- Cover the complete equal-peer availability matrix and the new summary
  contract with regression tests.

## 0.15.0

- Add public EUMETSAT Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B SLSTR Level 2 near-real-time
  FRP observations as separate, credential-free equal peers for locations
  between 82°S and 82°N.
- Query only bounded monitored-location areas through the official EUMETView
  WFS, with a one-day time window, 15-minute cache, fixed host and layer names,
  no redirects, strict size/count limits and fail-closed GeoJSON validation.
- Preserve FRP, uncertainty, confidence, MWIR channel, pixel dimensions,
  satellite identity and acquisition time for normalized incident processing.
- Keep each Sentinel-3 satellite's health and backoff independent while
  suppressing duplicate, non-actionable Repairs for a shared public-service
  outage; provider health and diagnostics still report the failure.
- Add schedule, coverage, parsing, normalization, truncation, identity and
  failure-isolation regression tests plus implementation/privacy documentation.
- Identify whether each assigned active-fire feed is geostationary or
  polar-orbiting in the per-location source details.
- Expose safe Himawari-9 geographic coverage as an inactive opportunity for
  relevant Asia-Pacific locations, without adding it to the active source
  count or treating it as fire evidence.
- Explain that Himawari activation remains blocked on a documented, licensed
  machine-access endpoint; no unsupported map endpoint or full-disk imagery is
  queried.
- Add regression tests proving that Tokyo reports one active NASA FIRMS source
  plus a separate inactive Himawari opportunity, while locations outside the
  conservative Himawari gate do not report it.
- Accept current NOAA GOES floating-point science fields when optional NetCDF
  packing attributes are absent, while preserving strict units, range, shape,
  projection and source validation.

## 0.14.0

- Rename the wildfire product to **TerraLyra IGNIS** and establish a dedicated
  repository, defining the product boundary needed for future
  TerraLyra integrations such as TREMOR, FLUMEN and AERIS.
- Adopt the collision-resistant `terralyra_ignis` Home Assistant domain now,
  before public distribution. This intentionally creates new config entries,
  entity IDs, map-source IDs, service names and event names.
- Rename the Python package and internal integration classes to IGNIS-specific
  identities while keeping provider-normalization and incident logic intact.
- Update HACS metadata, documentation links, user agents, workflows,
  translations, examples and regression tests for the new identity.
- Document the one-time clean migration from the pre-release `terralyra`
  integration. Automatic cross-domain migration is deliberately not attempted.

## 0.13.0

- Activate Meteosat-9 MSG-IODC FRP-PIXEL as an equal active-fire source for
  monitored locations inside its conservative 45.5°E coverage gate.
- Add bounded HDF5 science-array decoding with product-identity, quality,
  shape, type, missing-value, scale, coordinate and acquisition-time checks.
- Reuse the configured LSA SAF account, download one shared IODC product for
  all covered locations and isolate its retry/health state from healthy peers.
- Preserve the 15-minute IODC cadence in next-update estimates and expose the
  source in coverage, diagnostics and incident attribution.
- Treat MTG and MSG-IODC as equal observing feeds from the same LSA SAF FRP
  evidence family, avoiding a false independent-confirmation claim when their
  observations overlap.
- Replace the removed `aiohttp.encode_basic_auth` helper with the compatible
  `BasicAuth.encode()` API.

## 0.12.0

- Add an explicit, response-only Home Assistant action for inspecting one
  current MSG-IODC FRP-PIXEL List Product with the LSA SAF credentials already
  stored in the selected TerraLyra configuration.
- Keep the compatibility check runtime-disabled and privacy-safe: no redirects,
  a 2 MiB download limit, a 60-second overall timeout, no retained upstream file
  and no reads of fire-observation array values.
- Return only bounded HDF5 structure and attribute metadata for review before a
  synthetic fixture, decoder and live Meteosat-9 provider are implemented.
- Add action names and descriptions in English, Hungarian, German, French,
  Spanish and Italian, plus regression tests and user documentation.

## 0.11.0

- Add NASA FIRMS Terra and Aqua MODIS near-real-time active-fire observations
  alongside the existing NOAA-20 and NOAA-21 VIIRS feeds, using the same
  user-supplied MAP_KEY and bounded 15-minute cache.
- Treat observations from different satellites as independent evidence even
  when they arrive through the same provider, while preventing duplicate FRP
  values from being added together.
- Preserve contributing satellite names on live and persisted incidents and
  expose them in Home Assistant attributes.
- Extend the expected-observation estimate with broad Terra/Aqua nominal local
  overpass windows without presenting them as precise orbital predictions.
- Clarify the NOAA GOES Repair message: the public GOES source needs no account,
  API key or credentials, so users should check service availability instead.

## 0.10.0

- Add a translated timestamp sensor for every enabled monitored location that
  shows the next expected update from its earliest currently usable equal
  active-fire source.
- Estimate MTG and GOES updates from their 10-minute product cadence and NASA
  FIRMS refreshes from its bounded 15-minute client cache.
- Include a deliberately broad, longitude-adjusted NOAA-20/21 VIIRS nominal
  overpass window without presenting it as an exact orbital prediction.
- Preserve each provider's last successful product and receipt timestamps in
  health details across temporary per-provider backoff periods.
- Remove next-update entities automatically when their monitored location is
  disabled or deleted, and add regression tests for scheduling and cleanup.

## 0.9.0

- Add a common reliability layer for the equal-peer MTG, GOES and NASA FIRMS
  active-fire providers, distinguishing authentication, rate-limit, timeout,
  service-outage, no-product and invalid-response states.
- Honor bounded upstream `Retry-After` hints and exponentially delay only a
  failing peer while healthy providers continue at the normal polling rate.
- Expose privacy-safe failure category, consecutive-failure count and next
  retry time in provider health attributes and diagnostics.
- Create one translated, self-clearing Home Assistant Repair per failing
  upstream provider; authentication is reported immediately and transient
  failures only after three consecutive attempts.
- Persist the size-bounded last valid FRMv3 PNG for up to 24 hours so the
  same-date, same-bounds outage fallback survives a Home Assistant restart.
- Add regression coverage for retry deferral, recovery, Repair lifecycle,
  normalized provider errors and safe FRMv3 cache restoration.

## 0.8.7

- Keep the last valid FRMv3 map available for up to 24 hours when a refresh is
  temporarily rate-limited, the service returns a transient server error, or
  the connection fails.
- Reuse a stale map only for the exact same bounds and forecast date, and never
  conceal authentication errors or serve an expired image.
- Remove the stale development version from the FRMv3 HTTP User-Agent.

## 0.8.6

- Improve FRMv3 reliability by classifying temporary HTTP failures (auth/rate-limit/
  temporary service), capturing `Retry-After` hints when present, and using that
  signal for smarter backoff.
- Add clearer FRMv3 outage diagnostics including the last failure reason in the
  warning repair notification.
- Keep the specialized FRMv3 HTTP failures compatible with existing HTTP error
  handling, and sanitize server-provided details before showing them.

## 0.8.5

- Make the NASA FIRMS multi-area active-fire provider resilient to partial area
  failures, so one bad monitoring box no longer invalidates all FIRMS detections.
- Add regression coverage for partial and complete FIRMS multi-area failures.

## 0.8.4

- Add more actionable FRMv3 diagnostics when the WMS endpoint returns a non-200
  status, capturing a bounded response snippet for easier root-cause detection.
- Add regression coverage for non-200 FRMv3 HTTP error diagnostics.

## 0.8.3

- Keep FRMv3 daily forecast entities available even when the rendered map image
  cannot be fetched or analyzed during transient outages; only the map-derived
  area-maximum value falls back to its forecast sample.


## 0.8.2

- Keep FRMv3 fire-risk forecast updates resilient when future dates are not
  yet available: a 404 for future forecast days is treated as missing data
  for that specific day instead of failing the whole forecast.
- Preserve 1xx/4xx/5xx failures for current forecast day to surface a clear
  integration outage signal when the immediate-risk map is truly unavailable.
- Add regression coverage for partial future-date 404 tolerance.

## 0.8.1

- Remove persisted fire incidents that no longer belong to any enabled
  monitored location, preventing deleted locations from leaving stale map
  markers.
- Reset the bounded 24-hour activity aggregate when obsolete location tracks
  are removed, preventing misleading incident totals after location changes.
- Apply the same current-location relevance check while building map entities
  as an additional fail-safe.

## 0.8.0

- Add a translated monitoring-status sensor for every enabled location, clearly
  distinguishing all sources available, partial availability, initialization
  and complete unavailability.
- Show the health of each automatically assigned equal-peer provider and
  satellite in the location sensor attributes, without exposing coordinates.
- Include the latest received/product timestamps plus per-location active and
  independently corroborated incident counts.
- Remove orphaned location-status entities automatically when a monitored
  location is deleted, disabled or recreated.

## 0.7.4

- Align the German, Spanish, French, Hungarian and Italian option and repair
  text with automatic, location-based assignment of equal active-fire sources.
- Explain that NASA FIRMS is queried separately around every enabled monitored
  location rather than around a single selected monitoring center.
- Update authentication and outage wording for multi-source operation, and
  remove obsolete primary/supplemental terminology from user documentation.

## 0.7.3

- Remove orphaned per-location source sensors from Home Assistant's entity
  registry when a monitored location is deleted, disabled or recreated.
- Preserve all current per-location sensors, including user-customized entity
  names, while cleaning only obsolete TerraLyra source assignments.
- Add regression coverage for selective and complete location-source cleanup.

## 0.7.2

- Preserve every managed monitoring location when the general active-fire
  options form updates the transition monitoring center or radius.
- Keep secondary location source assignments active across general options
  reloads instead of turning their existing entities unavailable.
- Add regression coverage for a three-location Home, California and Uganda
  configuration.

## 0.7.1

- Retry failed FRMv3 fire-risk refreshes after 15, 30 and at most 60 minutes
  instead of leaving the entities unavailable until the next normal 12-hour
  cycle.
- Create a warning Repair after three consecutive FRMv3 failures and clear it
  automatically after the forecast service recovers.
- Report active-fire data as delayed once the latest product is older than the
  60-minute situation-assessment freshness limit.

## 0.7.0

- Add one user-facing source-assignment sensor for every enabled monitored
  location, showing the number, readable names and satellites of all
  automatically selected equal-peer active-fire sources.
- Enrich bounded coverage attributes with readable assignment details while
  keeping monitored coordinates out of entity state attributes.
- Add explicit Europe/United States automatic-assignment regression coverage
  and refresh documentation to remove remaining primary/secondary wording.

## 0.6.0

- Replace the configured primary/supplemental active-fire hierarchy with
  automatic source assignment for every enabled monitored location.
- Use all geographically relevant, configured sources as equal peers: MTG in
  its safe coverage area, GOES-18/19 in the Western Hemisphere, and NASA FIRMS
  globally when its key is configured.
- Continue updating from healthy peers during a partial provider outage and
  expose bounded per-source health and assignment details.
- Merge nearby observations from independent satellites into one incident,
  preserving multi-source confirmation without double-counting observed FRP.
- Migrate existing entries without requiring users to reselect a provider and
  add translated, provider-neutral setup, entity and Repair wording.
- Clarify active-fire entity scopes and document Home Assistant map-card
  limitations, attribution and recommended TerraLyra dashboard naming.

## 0.5.2

- Disambiguate simultaneous same-place fire markers without changing their
  stable incident-backed Home Assistant identities.
- Use the nearest actually affected monitored location for map distance,
  scalar location attributes and localized new-fire notifications.
- Include all other affected monitored-location names in one physical
  incident event instead of creating duplicate alerts.
- Query every enabled monitored location when optional NASA FIRMS
  corroboration is active, merging overlapping safe request boxes, keeping
  distant boxes separate and deduplicating repeated observations.

## 0.5.1

- Keep Home Assistant geolocation entity identities tied to stable TerraLyra
  incident IDs so a later fire cannot inherit another incident's history.
- Merge connected same-product detection chains during clustering, reducing
  overlapping map markers caused by source-pixel ordering.
- Remove the internal `firms-` prefix from fallback NASA FIRMS fire names.
- Add regression coverage for stable incident identities, connected clustering
  and user-facing FIRMS fallback names.

## 0.5.0

- Rename the existing active-fire cluster sensor to make clear that it counts
  only detections from the configured primary provider.
- Add a separate NASA FIRMS supplemental-cluster sensor containing only
  detections that are not already represented by a correlated primary-source
  incident.
- Add a combined active-fire cluster sensor that reports the deduplicated
  current total across the primary provider and supplemental NASA FIRMS data.
- Expose explicit count-scope and provider attributes, update all supported
  translations, and document why the primary count can be zero while the map
  still contains supplemental observations.

## 0.4.1

- Fix migration of legacy custom monitoring centers when Home Assistant uses an
  uppercase config-entry identifier by assigning a stable, validated local
  location ID instead of deriving one from the config entry.

## 0.4.0

- Replace the single custom monitoring center with a locally managed list of
  enabled monitored locations, each with its own name, coordinates and active-
  fire radius.
- Match active-fire incidents to every affected monitored location while
  retaining a stable primary-location distance for Home Assistant entities.
- Add translated location-management flows with strict validation and safe
  migration of existing single-center installations.
- Distinguish the configured primary active-fire provider from the provider
  actually observed in the latest product, avoiding misleading source labels.
- Add conservative per-location EUMETSAT LSA SAF and NOAA GOES coverage
  reporting, including an appropriate-provider recommendation when uncovered.
- Add actionable Home Assistant Repairs for rejected provider credentials,
  three consecutive provider failures and uncovered monitored locations.
  Repairs clear automatically when the underlying condition is corrected.
- Extend regression coverage and documentation for multi-location matching,
  provider identity, geographic coverage and repair-notice behavior.

## 0.3.0

- Add a setup and options workflow for choosing Home or one named custom
  active-fire monitoring center with strictly validated coordinates.
- Use the selected center consistently for the primary active-fire provider,
  NASA FIRMS bounds, distance calculations, alerts and map markers while
  keeping FRMv3 fire risk and land-surface temperature tied to Home.
- Allow European Home Assistant installations to create a coverage-gated NOAA
  GOES entry for a safely covered Western Hemisphere test location.
- Show the center name and rounded coordinates as attributes of the active-fire
  data-source sensor and use the name in localized mobile notifications.
- Separate persisted incident tracks and activity history when the center
  changes so detections from two locations cannot be mixed.
- Add English, Hungarian, German, French, Spanish and Italian setup text plus
  regression tests for custom centers, validation, GOES coverage and alerts.

## 0.2.7

- Audit all English, Hungarian, German, French, Spanish and Italian translation
  schemas and guard against accidental English fallback text.
- Reconcile the README with the released GOES primary-provider workflow,
  provider-neutral map behavior, current architecture and remaining roadmap.

## 0.2.6

- Add a translated primary-provider setup step for EUMETSAT LSA SAF and NOAA
  GOES-18/19.
- Allow safely covered Western Hemisphere installations to use GOES without an
  LSA SAF account while retaining the existing credential flow for LSA SAF.
- Explain GOES coverage, account and additional-download implications before
  activation, and reject uncovered Home locations before creating an entry.
- Add a regression test for the exact geolocation attributes consumed by Home
  Assistant's native Map-card source selector.
- Add a strict primary-provider factory that preserves existing LSA SAF entries
  while preparing a coverage-gated GOES runtime path without silent fallback.
- Test LSA SAF compatibility, GOES-East selection, European exclusion, missing
  credentials and unknown-provider rejection at the provider boundary.
- Show the selected active-fire provider, satellite and product in a translated
  Home Assistant sensor, and expose the `terralyra` map-source identifier on
  the active-fire summary even when no marker is currently available.
- Add a network-free end-to-end GOES runtime test covering bounded download,
  temporary-file cleanup, direct NetCDF decoding and provider normalization.
- Add conservative spherical coverage selection for the operational GOES-18
  and GOES-19 satellites while rejecting Europe and near-limb locations.
- Add a fixed-host, redirect-free and size-limited NOAA catalogue discovery
  client that inspects only the current and previous UTC product hour.
- Strictly validate GOES catalogue XML, object paths, filenames, satellite
  identity, timestamps and advertised NetCDF object size before download, using
  a pinned attack-resistant XML parser.
- Add tests for satellite selection, European exclusion, UTC prefixes and
  malformed, oversized or cross-satellite catalogue objects.
- Document the completed production foundation and retain NetCDF downloading
  behind a separate package-size, memory and ARM compatibility gate.
- Record a real GOES-18/19 ARM64 decoder benchmark and select direct `h5py`
  conditionally; keep the native dependency and user option out until the
  bounded production decoder and miniature fixtures pass the remaining gate.
- Add the bounded direct-`h5py` FDCF decoder with stripe-based mask scanning,
  strict dimensions/chunks/units/projection validation, optional-value
  preservation and synthetic miniature fixtures. The decoder remains
  disconnected from normal integration operation pending provider activation.
- Add redirect-free, advertised-size-verified streaming downloads with
  executor-backed file writes and cancellation-safe temporary-file cleanup.
- Add a dedicated Python 3.14 GOES compatibility workflow on Linux x86-64 and
  ARM64 GitHub-hosted runners.
- Add a provider-neutral GOES active-fire adapter with conservative coverage
  selection, explicit freshness states and strict decoded-product identity
  checks. It remains unregistered until multi-provider coordination is ready.

## 0.2.5

- Localize generated fire-place descriptions and mobile notification text in
  English, Hungarian, German, Spanish, French, and Italian, with an English
  fallback for other Home Assistant languages.

- Audit and update the README against the current integration behavior,
  entities, options, privacy boundaries and provider attribution.
- Verify the native Map-card geolocation-source YAML and document why
  `terralyra` may be absent while no recent fire marker exists.
- Add complete NASA FIRMS setup, behavior, failure-isolation, privacy and
  supplemental-marker guidance.
- Correct obsolete MTLST roadmap and architecture descriptions, remove a
  duplicated installation step and decouple map history wording from alert
  memory.
- Remove a stale development version from the NASA FIRMS HTTP User-Agent.

## 0.2.4

- Reconcile persisted NASA FIRMS-only tracks with primary LSA SAF incidents
  across refresh cycles, preventing historical cross-provider duplicates.
- Prefix supplemental map entity names with `NASA FIRMS` so their source is
  immediately visible on Home Assistant maps and entity dialogs.
- Document migration of manually configured geolocation cards from the legacy
  `lsa_saf` source to `terralyra`.

## 0.2.3

- Show NASA FIRMS-only VIIRS detections as supplemental Home Assistant map
  markers when FIRMS corroboration is enabled.
- Suppress duplicate FIRMS markers when the same detection already corroborates
  an LSA SAF incident.
- Resolve the nearest settlement locally for supplemental FIRMS incidents and
  retain explicit NASA FIRMS source attribution.
- Use a separate identifier namespace for FIRMS incidents to prevent entity
  identity collisions with primary LSA SAF incidents.
- Keep FIRMS-only markers out of primary LSA SAF alerts and situation scoring.

## 0.2.2

- Add a separate, dashboard-adjustable 1–48 hour fire-history window for map
  markers.
- Keep inactive incidents visible for the selected history period without
  extending same-fire alert suppression.
- Preserve the previous six-hour behavior by default for existing users.

## 0.2.1

- Add a translated, explainable evidence-strength sensor for the nearest active
  fire detection, with `limited`, `moderate`, and `strong` states.
- Explain the assessment with bounded factors and cautions covering independent
  satellite corroboration, freshness, FRP, primary confidence, and pixel count.
- Explicitly label the assessment as integration-calculated and not an official
  emergency confirmation.

## 0.2.0

- Activate optional NASA FIRMS corroboration with the user's personal MAP_KEY.
- Query bounded NOAA-20 and NOAA-21 VIIRS feeds no more than once every 15
  minutes and keep FIRMS failures isolated from primary LSA SAF monitoring.
- Correlate independent detections within explicit 5 km and 6 hour gates.
- Expose translated source-confirmation states and per-incident provider,
  confirmation, and corroborating-detection attributes.

## 0.1.1

- Replace the fire-specific branding with TerraLyra's provider-neutral globe
  and observation-eye identity.
- Include a scalable SVG source and transparent 256 px and 512 px icons.

## 0.1.0

- Launch TerraLyra as a clean, provider-neutral Home Assistant integration
  under the new `terralyra` domain and `TerraLyra/ha-terralyra` repository.
- Include EUMETSAT LSA SAF active-fire monitoring, persistent incident tracking,
  trend and situation indicators, offline place-name lookup, and map entities.
- Include the FRMv3 ten-day fire-risk forecast, calendar, sensors, and bounded
  forecast-map camera with offline country borders.
- Include optional, default-off MTLST land-surface temperature monitoring with
  clear location-disclosure text.
- Include optional, default-off NASA FIRMS configuration and secure provider
  foundation for future multi-source corroboration.
- Preserve bounded downloads, strict URL and host validation, TLS verification,
  decompression and image limits, credential redaction, and privacy-safe
  diagnostics.
- Provide English, Hungarian, German, French, Spanish, and Italian interface
  translations.

TerraLyra does not automatically migrate the earlier `lsa_saf` development
integration. Remove the old integration before installing TerraLyra, then
recreate dashboards and automations with the new entity and event names.
