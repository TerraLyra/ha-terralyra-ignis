# TerraLyra IGNIS for Home Assistant

> Moving from `TerraLyra/ha-ignis`? Read the [repository migration guide](docs/REPOSITORY_MIGRATION.md) before changing HACS sources. Keep your existing IGNIS integration configured.

A HACS-compatible wildfire intelligence and early-warning integration for
Home Assistant. TerraLyra IGNIS automatically assigns every geographically
relevant
active-fire source to each monitored location: **EUMETSAT LSA SAF MTG** and
**Meteosat-9 MSG-IODC** in their safe coverage areas, **NOAA GOES-18/19** in
the Western Hemisphere, public **Sentinel-3A/3B SLSTR** observations outside
the extreme polar caps, and optional **NASA FIRMS** global observations.
Assigned sources are equal peers: none is
labelled primary or secondary, and independent observations can corroborate
the same incident. Fire-risk forecasting and land-surface temperature remain
available where they directly support wildfire awareness.

Repository: `https://github.com/TerraLyra/ha-terralyra-ignis`

> TerraLyra IGNIS is an independent project. It is not an official EUMETSAT, LSA SAF,
> NASA, or FIRMS integration.

> **One-time product migration:** release 0.14.0 uses the new
> `terralyra_ignis` Home Assistant domain. Remove the pre-release **TerraLyra**
> (`terralyra`) integration before installing this version, then add
> **TerraLyra IGNIS** as a new integration. Settings and entity IDs cannot be
> moved safely across Home Assistant integration domains. Update dashboards,
> map source filters and automations to the new `terralyra_ignis_*` identities.
> Follow the complete [0.14 migration checklist](docs/MIGRATION_TO_IGNIS.md)
> before deleting the old integration.

## Product boundary

IGNIS is TerraLyra's wildfire product. It combines relevant observations from
multiple providers into location-aware incidents without relabelling
third-party data as its own. Future earthquake, flood and atmospheric-hazard
products can live in separate integrations without sharing IGNIS's Home
Assistant domain or entity namespace. The durable naming and repository rules
are recorded in
[`docs/PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Product status

Version 0.25.0 adds an opt-in **Reports — NSW RFS fires** calendar for
regional fire reports inside enabled monitored-location radii. This uses the
current official feed, not a historical archive or automatic satellite matching.
See [NSW RFS reports](docs/NSW_RFS_REPORTS.md) for setup and limitations.

Version 0.22.0 adds a disabled-by-default **Reports — GDACS wildfire context**
calendar. It provides attributed international wildfire context, not independent
satellite evidence or a replacement for local authority warnings. Coverage and
spatial matching are deliberately limited; see [GDACS context](docs/GDACS_CONTEXT.md)
before enabling it. Existing BM OKF links need no migration.

| Product | Source / ID | Resolution / cadence | Integration status |
|---|---|---|---|
| MTG Fire Radiative Power Pixel | LSA-509 / MTFRPPIXEL | ~1 km / 10 min | **Implemented** |
| MSG-IODC Fire Radiative Power Pixel | LSA-502 / FRPPixel | ~3.1 km / 15 min | **Implemented, coverage-gated** |
| GOES ABI Fire/Hot Spot Characterization | ABI-L2-FDCF | ~2 km / 10 min full disk | **Implemented, coverage-gated** |
| Sentinel-3 SLSTR Level 2 NRT Fire Radiative Power | EO:EUM:DAT:0417 / public EUMETView WFS | ~1 km / polar overpasses, normally within 3 h | **Implemented, automatically enabled** |
| Fire Risk Map v3 Forecast | FRMv3 | Europe / daily, day 0…9 | **Implemented** |
| MTG Land Surface Temperature | LSA-007 / MTLST | ~2 km / 10 min; up to 60 min publication delay | **Implemented, optional** |
| Independent active-fire corroboration | NASA FIRMS NOAA-20/NOAA-21 VIIRS + Terra/Aqua MODIS NRT | ~375 m–1 km / provider-dependent NRT latency | **Implemented, optional** |
| Evapotranspiration | LSA SAF ET family | product-dependent | Roadmap |
| Solar radiation / fluxes | LSA SAF radiation family | product-dependent | Roadmap |
| Vegetation metrics | NDVI/FVC/LAI/FAPAR/GPP | product-dependent | Roadmap |

The integration automatically enables all credential-free sources covering a
location and any configured credentialed source. It also enables the public
**FRMv3 Fire Risk Map** forecast. The MTLST point sensor and NASA FIRMS source
are optional and disabled until explicitly configured.

## MTG Land Surface Temperature

MTLST reports the radiative temperature of the land surface, not the shaded air
temperature reported by a weather station. When explicitly enabled in the
integration options, Home Assistant sends the configured Home latitude and
longitude to the official `adaguc.lsasvcs.ipma.pt` LSA SAF WMS approximately
every 15 minutes. The option is disabled by default; while disabled, no MTLST
request is made and no MTLST entity is created.

The sensor exposes the latest temperature in the user's preferred temperature
unit. Attributes preserve the observation time, sampled coordinates, product
quality label, uncertainty in kelvin, product ID, source, and CC BY 4.0
attribution. A clear-sky satellite observation can be unavailable because of
cloud, coverage, or publication delay; such a result remains unavailable rather
than being replaced with an invented value.

## Active-fire detection

For EUMETSAT installations, the integration reads the compressed CSV
ListProduct from:

`MTG / MTFRPPixel / NATIVE`

When the same LSA SAF account has a monitored location inside the conservative
IODC coverage gate, TerraLyra IGNIS also reads the bounded HDF5 List Product from:

`MSG-IODC / FRP-PIXEL / HDF5`

The Meteosat-9 and MTG feeds are equal operational sources, but both belong to
the LSA SAF FRP-Pixel evidence family. Their overlap is therefore deduplicated
without being presented as two scientifically independent confirmations.

For covered Western Hemisphere locations, NOAA GOES uses the public
ABI-L2-FDCF full-disk product without provider credentials. Every assigned
provider passes normalized detections to the same filtering, cross-source
deduplication, clustering, tracking and alert pipeline. On first setup
TerraLyra IGNIS seeds the current snapshot
without emitting `new_fire` events, so already-existing fires do not cause an
alert flood.

Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B use the public EUMETView WFS layers for the SLSTR
Level 2 near-real-time FRP product. They need no account or API key and are
separate equal peers, so a nearby observation from each satellite can
corroborate an incident. IGNIS requests only the small bounding boxes around
enabled monitored locations, with a fixed 24-hour time window, a 15-minute
cache and strict response-size, feature-count, identity, timestamp and science
field validation. A current empty feature collection means a valid zero-fire
observation, not an outage. The product confidence field is normalized to the
common 0–1 model but is not presented as a calibrated probability of fire.

### Entities

- `sensor.*_nearest_active_fire` – distance to the nearest active fire cluster
- `sensor.*_all_active_fire_clusters` – current, cross-source-deduplicated
  incident total from every assigned source
- `sensor.*_nasa_firms_*` – the subset observed by NASA FIRMS; this is a source
  breakdown, not a secondary-source count
- `sensor.*_fire_pixels_in_radius` – raw provider detections after filters
- `sensor.*_latest_fire_product_time` – time of the latest processed provider product
- `sensor.*_fire_product_age` – age of the latest product in minutes
- `sensor.*_active_fire_data_source` – automatic assignment state, with every
  assigned provider, satellite and health state as attributes
- `sensor.*_active_fire_sources` – one entity per enabled monitored location;
  its numeric state is the number of automatically assigned equal sources and
  its attributes list their readable provider names and satellites
- `sensor.*_active_fire_data_status` – provider health and freshness, including
  delayed, no-product and outage states
- `sensor.*_fire_detections_in_the_last_hour` – detections during the last hour,
  with 3-hour and 6-hour counters as bounded attributes
- `sensor.*_fire_activity_frp_change_over_one_hour` – aggregate clustered FRP
  change over one hour, with the 3-hour change as a bounded attribute
- `sensor.*_new_fire_incidents_in_the_last_24_hours` – new tracked incidents in
  the rolling 24-hour window
- `sensor.*_nearest_fire_evidence_strength` – explainable strength of the
  satellite evidence for the nearest incident; never an official confirmation
- `sensor.*_independent_fire_source_confirmation` – whether an incident is
  observed by one source or corroborated by multiple equal sources
- `sensor.*_active_fire_situation` – explainable integration-calculated summary
  of current detected activity (`normal`, `elevated`, `high`, `critical`, or
  `unknown`)
- `event.*_new_active_fire` – Home Assistant Event entity for a newly deduplicated fire
- `event.*_fire_incident_trend_change` – meaningful, cooldown-protected trend changes
- `calendar.*_fire_incident_history` – searchable 30-day local archive of
  detected incidents with source, satellite, location and peak-intensity details
- `geo_location.*` – one map marker per recently tracked, deduplicated incident
- `number.*_active_fire_monitoring_radius` – dashboard-adjustable monitoring radius
- `number.*_fire_history_window` – dashboard-adjustable 1–48 hour period for
  retaining inactive incident markers without extending alert deduplication

Entity IDs are generated by Home Assistant and may differ depending on language and naming choices.

### Fire map

Each recently tracked cluster is exposed as a native Home Assistant `geo_location`
entity. The marker contains its coordinates, distance from the selected
active-fire monitoring center, current and peak FRP, confidence, acquisition
time, pixel count, incident lifecycle, duration,
historical maxima, and FRP/activity/distance trends. Trend states are calculated
from a bounded 90-minute observation window. They remain `unknown` until at
least three observations spanning 20 minutes are available.
Markers keep the same identity while the cluster remains within the configured
same-fire matching radius. Inactive markers remain visible for the independent
**Fire history window** (1–48 hours) and are removed automatically afterward.
Changing this display window does not extend repeat-alert suppression.

### Fire incident history

The **Overview — Fire incident history** calendar preserves detected incidents
for retrospective checks after their map markers expire. Each calendar entry
contains the first and last observation time, coordinates, affected monitored
locations, contributing providers and satellites, peak FRP, maximum pixel count
and total detection samples. The archive is stored locally in Home Assistant,
is limited to 30 days or 500 incidents, and reuses existing provider results
without making extra API requests. Removing a monitored location also removes
archive entries that are no longer relevant to any enabled location.

Add a **Map** card to a dashboard and select the `terralyra_ignis` geolocation source, or
use this YAML configuration:

```yaml
type: map
geo_location_sources:
  - source: terralyra_ignis
    label_mode: icon
hours_to_show: 24
```

`label_mode: icon` displays the integration's fire icon instead of a shortened
text label. Clicking a marker shows its exact latitude and longitude together
with the fire attributes. FIRMS-only entity names begin with **NASA FIRMS ·**
so the source is also visible in the entity dialog.

To overlay the configured active-fire monitoring radii, also select the
`terralyra_ignis_monitoring_areas` geolocation source. For consistent circle
visibility, disable marker grouping and keep the area centers out of automatic
map fitting:

```yaml
type: map
geo_location_sources:
  - source: terralyra_ignis
    label_mode: icon
  - source: terralyra_ignis_monitoring_areas
    label_mode: icon
    focus: false
cluster: false
hours_to_show: 24
```

Each enabled location receives a center marker and a circle whose radius follows
its **Active-fire monitoring radius** setting. The circle updates after the
integration reload triggered by a location or radius change. It represents only
the configured search and alert boundary—not a fire perimeter, satellite
coverage footprint, location uncertainty, evacuation area, or safety guarantee.
Home Assistant's native map currently consumes its generic GPS-accuracy circle
decoration for this overlay, so the raw compatibility attribute is named
`gps_accuracy`; the explicit `monitoring_radius_km` and `map_circle_meaning`
attributes state the actual meaning.

The integration resolves the nearest settlement locally from its bundled
GeoNames `cities500` database. It sends no fire or Home coordinates to an
external geocoding service, has no lookup quota, and remains available without
internet access. Lookup runs outside Home Assistant's event loop and the
database is opened read-only. Place data is provided by GeoNames under CC BY
4.0. The feature is enabled by default and can be disabled in the integration
options.

### Home Assistant bus event

Every newly detected/deduplicated nearby fire also fires:

```text
terralyra_ignis_new_fire
```

Event data includes:

- `distance_km`
- `latitude`
- `longitude`
- `frp_mw`
- `peak_frp_mw`
- `confidence`
- `acquired`
- `pixel_count`
- `track_id`
- `incident_id`
- `lifecycle`
- `first_seen`
- `last_seen`
- `duration_minutes`
- `minimum_distance_km`
- `maximum_frp_mw`
- `maximum_pixel_count`
- `detections_total`
- `maximum_confidence`
- `frp_trend`
- `activity_trend`
- `distance_trend`
- `confirmation_level`
- `providers`
- `satellites`
- `corroborating_detections`
- `place_name`
- `nearest_settlement`
- `location_description`
- `notification_title`
- `notification_message`
- `location_id`
- `location_name`
- `location_radius_km`
- `direction`
- `inside_radius`
- `location_matches`
- `affected_locations`
- `product_time`
- `source_url`

For incidents relevant to multiple configured places, scalar distance and
location fields refer to the nearest place whose monitoring radius contains
the incident. `location_matches` retains the bounded per-location detail, and
`affected_locations` lists the places named in the single new-fire event and
notification. TerraLyra IGNIS does not emit one duplicate event per place.

Meaningful incident trend transitions also fire:

```text
terralyra_ignis_fire_trend
```

Its `event_type` is one of `fire_intensity_increasing`,
`fire_activity_increasing`, `fire_activity_decreasing`, or `fire_approaching`.
The integration only emits a transition after the trend engine's minimum sample
and duration rules are satisfied. A persisted 60-minute per-incident,
per-event-type cooldown prevents notification floods, including across restarts.

### Activity history

The integration persists a compact rolling 24-hour FRP/incident history, capped
at 180 product observations, and a separate six-hour observation ledger capped
at 20,000 identities. Raw observation arrays are not exposed as entity attributes.
Since 0.24.4, recent "detections" count distinct filtered source observations by
acquisition time, not repeated product downloads. "New incidents" counts newly
created deduplicated incident IDs. Collection-window and retention-limit flags
describe incomplete counts; neither guarantees complete satellite coverage.
Old aggregate counts are not converted and Recorder history is not deleted;
see [0.24.4 upgrade notes](docs/RELEASE_0_24_4.md).
FRP change is the difference between the first and last total clustered FRP in
the selected window and remains unavailable until at least two samples exist.

### Active Fire Situation

Active Fire Situation is deliberately separate from the FRMv3 **Fire Risk**
forecast. Fire Risk describes environmental conditions that favour fire;
Active Fire Situation summarizes current satellite-detected activity. It is an
integration-calculated situation indicator, not an official emergency or
fire-danger classification.

The score is deterministic and uses only bounded inputs:

- nearest detection: 5/4/3/2/1 points within 10/25/50/100/250 km;
- active incidents: 1 point for at least 2, 2 points for at least 5;
- highest current FRP: 1 point from 30 MW, 2 points from 100 MW;
- detected activity approaching Home: 2 points;
- increasing FRP and increasing detection activity: 1 point each.

With fresh provider data, no current detections is `normal`. Any current
detection is at least `elevated`; `high` requires a detection within 100 km and
at least 5 points, while `critical` requires a detection within 25 km and at
least 7 points. If the provider is delayed/unavailable or the product is older
than 60 minutes, the state is `unknown` rather than a potentially misleading
`normal`.

### Data freshness and provider health

An empty active-fire cluster count means that a current satellite product was
successfully processed and contained no matching detections. It is deliberately
different from a provider failure. The **Active-fire data status** sensor reports:

- `available` for a current valid product;
- `delayed` when the newest valid assigned-source product exceeds its freshness threshold;
- `no_product` when no assigned source has a recent product;
- `outage` when all assigned sources fail to return a safe, valid response;
- `auth_error` when saved credentials require reauthentication.

The status attributes include the provider, satellite, product timestamp and
the time Home Assistant received the product. Failed refreshes retain the last
successful data and persistent fire tracks; they are never converted into a
false zero-fire observation.

Each assigned source is retried independently. TerraLyra IGNIS honors bounded
`Retry-After` advice and uses exponential backoff for repeated failures, while
healthy equal peers continue normally. Provider health attributes and
privacy-safe diagnostics distinguish authentication, rate-limit, timeout,
service-outage, no-product and invalid-response states, including the next
retry time.

Provider health and geographic coverage are intentionally separate. The
**Sources — Location coverage** entity evaluates every enabled location using
conservative pre-download satellite geometry and reports `covered`, `partially
covered`, or `not covered`. TerraLyra IGNIS also creates one
**Location: &lt;name&gt; — Active-fire sources** sensor per location. Its state is
the assigned source count and its attributes show the readable provider names,
satellites and the equal-peer relationship without exposing the location
coordinates.

The companion per-location monitoring-status sensor distinguishes full
freshness from reduced service: `available` means every assigned source is
current, `degraded` means every source remains usable but at least one is
delayed, `partial` means at least one equal peer is unavailable while another
still works, and `unavailable` means that no assigned source is usable.
Its attributes provide fresh, delayed, unavailable and initializing source
counts and stable provider-ID lists for Home Assistant automations. Each
source-health entry also includes the last product and receipt timestamps,
failure category, consecutive-failure count and next retry time when known.

The additional **Location: &lt;name&gt; — Active-fire observation** sensor explains
what the current map result means. It distinguishes active detections, no
active detections with full source availability, no detections under limited
coverage, startup and complete data unavailability. Attributes list the exact
fresh, delayed, unavailable and initializing source counts plus stable reason
codes. `No active detections` is explicitly an observation result, never an
all-clear or confirmation that no fire exists; clouds, smoke, tree cover,
satellite timing and detection thresholds can still hide a fire.

Entity display names expose their scope before the metric so alphabetical Home
Assistant lists remain readable. `Location: <name> —` identifies location-bound
values, `Overview —` combines all enabled monitored locations, and `Sources —`
contains provider assignment, health and evidence details. Provider-specific
counts, raw pixels and the legacy all-source count are diagnostic entities and
are disabled by default for new installations. Existing entity IDs and user
automations are not renamed or removed during upgrade.

Every TerraLyra IGNIS map marker separately names the provider or providers that
supplied the incident evidence: LSA SAF, NOAA GOES, NASA FIRMS, or multiple
sources. Home Assistant map cards may also combine geolocation entities from
other integrations.

## Installation through HACS

1. In HACS, add `TerraLyra/ha-terralyra-ignis` as a **Custom repository** of type
   **Integration**.
2. Install **TerraLyra IGNIS**.
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. Go to **Settings → Devices & services → Add integration → TerraLyra IGNIS**.
5. Keep **Home** as the initial monitored location or manage additional named
   locations in the integration options.
6. Optionally enter LSA SAF Data Service credentials to add geographically
   relevant MTG and Meteosat-9 MSG-IODC observations
   where its safe footprint covers a location.
7. TerraLyra IGNIS automatically adds GOES-18/19 where geographically relevant,
   plus public Sentinel-3A/3B SLSTR coverage outside the extreme polar caps.
   NASA FIRMS observations are added when a personal MAP_KEY is configured.

A free LSA SAF Data Service account is required only for the MTFRPPixel
provider. GOES downloads the newest validated public NOAA full-disk product and
therefore adds network, storage, decoder and memory cost. TerraLyra IGNIS rejects
unsafe navigation results, and GOES is assigned only to locations inside its
conservative coverage gate.

## Active fire options

- **Monitoring radius**: 1–500 km. Also exposed as a location-prefixed Number
  entity so it can be changed from a dashboard.
- **Managed monitored locations**: locally stored names, coordinates and
  radii used for automatic source assignment, distance sensors, alerts and
  fire markers. FRMv3 fire risk and MTLST remain tied to Home.
- **Minimum fire confidence**: 0.0–1.0.
- **Minimum FRP**: filters weak detections by Fire Radiative Power in MW.
- **Check interval**: how often Home Assistant looks for a newer product. The source product itself is nominally 10-minute data.
- **Same-fire matching radius**: nearby detections are considered the same physical fire.
- **Same-fire memory**: how long an already-seen fire suppresses a repeat `new_fire` event.
- **Overview — Fire history window**: independently controls how long inactive markers
  remain visible on the map.
- **Location: Home — Fire-risk forecast radius**: controls FRMv3 regional maximum sampling and
  the static map extent; it does not change active-fire alerts.
- **Resolve nearby place names**: uses the bundled offline GeoNames database.
- **Land-surface temperature**: creates the optional MTLST point sensor and
  sends Home coordinates to the official LSA SAF WMS while enabled.
- **NASA FIRMS corroboration**: enables independent VIIRS and MODIS comparison and
  requires the user's own FIRMS MAP_KEY.

## Public Sentinel-3 SLSTR source

Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B are enabled automatically for monitored locations
between 82°S and 82°N. They are polar-orbiting sources, so the 15-minute API
check interval is not a promise of a new satellite pass every 15 minutes.
Product observations arrive in swaths and may be delayed by processing and
publication; cloud, the orbit path, filtering and a genuine absence of active
fire can all produce no detections for a location.

Home Assistant sends each enabled location's bounded monitoring-area rectangle
to the official public EUMETView WFS. No TerraLyra account, EUMETSAT account or
secret is sent. The service receives coordinates and ordinary HTTP metadata,
so users who do not want their monitoring areas disclosed to EUMETSAT should
not install or enable this integration until a per-source switch is available.
Temporary Sentinel-3 service failures remain visible in provider-health
attributes and diagnostics, but do not create duplicate non-actionable Repairs.

## Optional NASA FIRMS source

NASA FIRMS is disabled by default. To enable it, create a personal FIRMS
MAP_KEY, open **Settings → Devices & services → TerraLyra IGNIS → Configure**, enable
NASA FIRMS observations and enter the key. TerraLyra IGNIS validates the key before
saving the option.

When enabled, TerraLyra IGNIS requests only the bounded areas around all enabled
monitored locations from the NOAA-20 and NOAA-21 VIIRS plus Terra and Aqua
MODIS near-real-time feeds.
Overlapping safe boxes are merged; geographically distant boxes remain
separate, with at most ten planned areas. Results are deduplicated across
areas. Requests are cached for at least 15 minutes, use a maximum one-day query
window, and are isolated from their equal peers: a FIRMS outage cannot stop
healthy MTG or GOES updates.

Detections within 5 km and 6 hours are treated as independent corroboration.
Independent satellites remain separate evidence even when NASA FIRMS delivers
them through the same API. Their duplicate observations are clustered without
adding the same fire energy twice, and contributing satellite names are kept
on the incident attributes.
FIRMS-only detections can appear as **NASA FIRMS · …** map markers. Nearby
observations from independent providers are correlated into one incident, with
the contributing providers preserved as evidence. The source-specific and
all-source count sensors remain available so users can understand the scope of
each value without implying a provider hierarchy.

Enabling the option sends each required monitoring-area bounding box and the
user's MAP_KEY to the official NASA FIRMS service. Exact place names are not
sent. The key is stored in the Home Assistant config entry, redacted from
diagnostics and never logged.

## Expected active-fire updates

Every enabled monitored location has a **Next expected active-fire update**
timestamp sensor. It selects the earliest currently usable equal source and
keeps the complete source-by-source estimate in its attributes:

- MTG and GOES use the official 10-minute product cadence, anchored to the
  latest successfully received product.
- NASA FIRMS uses TerraLyra IGNIS's bounded 15-minute API refresh interval. Its
  attributes also include a broad longitude-adjusted NOAA-20/21 VIIRS and
  Terra/Aqua MODIS nominal overpass window.

These values are estimates, not service guarantees. Publication latency,
clouds, scan-mode changes, maintenance and upstream outages can delay usable
data. The polar-orbit window intentionally avoids false minute-level precision; an
exact orbital pass predictor would require current orbital elements from an
additional external service.

## Example iPhone notification automation

```yaml
alias: TerraLyra IGNIS - new fire notification
triggers:
  - trigger: event
    event_type: terralyra_ignis_new_fire
actions:
  - action: notify.mobile_app_iphone_13_pro
    data:
      title: "{{ trigger.event.data.notification_title }}"
      message: "{{ trigger.event.data.notification_message }}"
mode: queued
```

The integration resolves the nearest settlement before publishing a new-fire
event. `notification_title` and `notification_message` are concise and follow
the Home Assistant system language in English, Hungarian, German, Spanish,
French and Italian. Unsupported languages fall back to English. If place-name
lookup is disabled or unavailable, the message safely falls back to distance
from the named active-fire monitoring center.

## FRMv3 fire-risk forecast

The integration also reads the public demonstration **FRMv3 Fire Risk Map v3**
service for Europe. It creates:

- a **Location: Home — Fire risk today** sensor, with all ten daily forecasts
  in its `forecast` attribute;
- a separate **Location: Home — Highest fire risk within radius** sensor;
- a localized **Location: Home — Fire-risk forecast day** selector;
- an independent **Location: Home — Fire-risk forecast radius** control;
- a **Location: Home — Fire-risk forecast map** camera showing the selected day;
- a **Location: Home — Fire-risk forecast update** status sensor;
- a localized **Location: Home — 10-day fire-risk forecast** calendar entity;
- a **Location: Home — Fire risk increase** event when the area maximum rises
  to high or worse.

FRMv3 has five levels: low, moderate, high, very high and extreme. Because an
exact Home coordinate can be an urban or otherwise non-burnable `nodata` pixel,
the local sensor uses the nearest valid sample within 10 km. The area sensor
separately scans the bounded FRMv3 raster inside the configured circular
monitoring radius and reports its highest risk pixel. Image analysis happens
locally and does not create additional point requests. This is a regional
planning indicator, not a property-level prediction.

The static Home Assistant map is annotated with its validity date, the Home
position, prominent offline GeoNames settlements, country borders and a
localized color legend. Country boundaries use a compact bundled extract from
Natural Earth at 1:110m scale and require no additional network request.

For the full outlook without YAML templates, add Home Assistant's standard
**Calendar** card to a dashboard and select the TerraLyra IGNIS **10-day fire-risk
forecast** calendar (displayed with the `Location: Home —` prefix). Each all-day
entry shows that day's localized risk level.
For free pan, zoom, time navigation and layer opacity controls, open the
[official LSA SAF ADAGUC viewer](https://adaguc.lsasvcs.ipma.pt/) and choose
**MSG – FRMv3 – Fire Risk** under Add layers. This uses the product owner's
viewer directly and needs no API key.

Home Assistant's **Visit website** link under **Settings → Devices & services →
TerraLyra IGNIS → TerraLyra IGNIS** opens the IGNIS project and support page.
To put a one-tap shortcut to the official interactive LSA SAF viewer on a
dashboard, add this Button card:

```yaml
type: button
name: Interactive fire-risk map
icon: mdi:map-search
tap_action:
  action: url
  url_path: https://adaguc.lsasvcs.ipma.pt/
```

Example dashboard card:

```yaml
type: picture-entity
entity: camera.terralyra_ignis_fire_risk_forecast_map
camera_view: auto
show_name: true
show_state: false
```

Add `select.terralyra_ignis_fire_risk_forecast_day` beside the image to choose a named
forecast day. Forecast data refreshes every 12 hours; generated map images are
cached for one hour. The most recent valid, size-bounded PNG can be reused for
the exact same date and bounds for up to 24 hours during a temporary outage,
including after a Home Assistant restart. Authentication failures are never
hidden by this fallback. Data is EUMETSAT / LSA SAF, CC BY 4.0; settlement
labels are GeoNames, CC BY 4.0.

To remain friendly to the public service at larger adoption levels, the raw map
download is shared by the regional analysis and camera preview. Each Home
Assistant installation also receives a stable, randomized offset within a
one-hour window around the twelve-hour forecast refresh interval, preventing
large groups of installations from keeping the same scheduled polling time.

For a compact ten-day outlook, add a Markdown card and replace the entity ID if
Home Assistant generated a different one:

```yaml
type: markdown
title: 10-day fire-risk outlook
content: >-
  {% set forecast = state_attr('sensor.terralyra_ignis_fire_risk_near_home', 'forecast') or [] %}
  {% set labels = {'low':'🟦 Low','moderate':'🟩 Moderate','high':'🟨 High','very_high':'🟧 Very high','extreme':'🟥 Extreme','unknown':'⬜ Unknown'} %}
  {% for day in forecast %}
  **{{ as_timestamp(day.date) | timestamp_custom('%a, %d %b') }}** — {{ labels.get(day.risk, day.risk) }}<br>
  {% endfor %}
```

The active-fire radius and fire-risk radius are deliberately independent. The
first controls detections and alerts; the second controls the static FRMv3 map
extent and regional maximum-risk sampling.

```

The `terralyra_ignis` domain is intentionally product-specific and
collision-resistant. Future TerraLyra products will use their own integration
domains and repositories while reusable abstractions are extracted only after
real cross-product reuse is proven.

### Migrating an existing map card

Dashboard geolocation-source selections belong to the user's dashboard and
cannot be rewritten by an integration update. If a map card was created for the
older development integration, edit that card, remove the legacy `lsa_saf` or
`terralyra` value from **Geolocation sources**, and select
`terralyra_ignis`. Single-source
markers name their observing provider and corroborated incidents retain all
contributors. Home Assistant only lists sources that currently have a loaded
`geo_location` entity. If no recent fire marker exists, leave the source filter
empty temporarily or enter `terralyra_ignis` in the card's YAML as shown above.

## Roadmap

### Next

- make fire-risk forecasting location-aware through a provider-neutral
  per-location contract: FRMv3 will be assigned to every safely covered
  location instead of being tied to Home, uncovered locations will not receive
  misleading unavailable entities, and JRC GWIS is the preferred worldwide
  candidate pending the bounded go/no-go checks in
  [`docs/FIRE_RISK_PROVIDER_RESEARCH.md`](docs/FIRE_RISK_PROVIDER_RESEARCH.md)
- obtain a documented near-real-time Himawari-9 FRP-PIXEL List Product endpoint
  and access terms; a conservative foundation now exposes geographically
  relevant Himawari coverage as an inactive opportunity without counting it as
  an active source, and the remaining go/no-go gates are recorded in
  [`docs/HIMAWARI_TECHNICAL_SPIKE.md`](docs/HIMAWARI_TECHNICAL_SPIKE.md)
- collect operational GOES-18/19 experience from covered installations while
  retaining the conservative pre-download coverage gate and product navigation
  checks; technical and resource details are in
  [`docs/GOES_TECHNICAL_SPIKE.md`](docs/GOES_TECHNICAL_SPIKE.md) and
  [`docs/GOES_DECODER_BENCHMARK.md`](docs/GOES_DECODER_BENCHMARK.md)
- continue localization and usability review on real Home Assistant dashboards;
  every enabled location now has a translated operational-status entity with
  equal-source health, timestamps and local incident-confirmation counts
- submit TerraLyra IGNIS artwork to the upstream Home Assistant brands repository

### MSG-IODC compatibility check

The active Meteosat-9 source can also be inspected without exposing the saved
LSA SAF password. In **Developer tools → Actions**, run
**TerraLyra IGNIS: Inspect MSG-IODC compatibility** and select the TerraLyra IGNIS
configuration. The explicit action downloads at most one small current List
Product, keeps it in memory, reads only bounded HDF5 metadata and returns the
sanitized schema in the action response. This diagnostic action does not alter
source assignment, retain the upstream file or read fire-observation values;
normal source updates use the separately bounded production decoder.

### Multi-source detection and incident verification

- nearby, temporally related provider tracks are consolidated into one stable
  presentation incident before IGNIS publishes map markers, counts, history or
  events; the raw source attribution remains available in bounded attributes
- the matching rules, identity guarantees and validation plan are documented
  in [Incident families and report context](docs/INCIDENT_FAMILIES_AND_REPORT_CONTEXT.md)
- NASA FIRMS can be enabled as an optional equal active-fire source with the
  user's personal MAP_KEY; it remains disabled by default
- bounded NOAA-20/21 VIIRS and Terra/Aqua MODIS Area API requests are cached for at least
  15 minutes and failures never stop healthy peer-source monitoring
- nearby independent-provider detections are correlated within explicit
  5 km and 6 hour gates, with source attribution retained on each incident
- FIRMS-only detections appear as source-labelled map markers with locally resolved
  nearest-settlement names; current and persisted cross-provider matches are
  reconciled instead of being displayed as duplicates
- the independent fire-source confirmation sensor distinguishes disabled,
  unavailable, single-source, and multi-source results
- expose a provider-neutral confirmation level instead of treating either
  satellite source as authoritative on its own
- distinguish detections seen by multiple satellites from single-source,
  low-intensity, stale, or otherwise uncertain thermal anomalies through a
  bounded, explainable evidence-strength sensor
- displayed fire-history window is configurable independently of same-fire
  alert suppression so provider observations can be compared consistently
- preserve source attribution, observation time, resolution, confidence, and
  FRP for every contributing detection

### News and official-report enrichment

- research a candidate catalogue of local, national, and cross-border fire
  information sources, including fire-service and civil-protection feeds,
  emergency alerts, public incident APIs, RSS/Atom feeds, and reputable news
  outlets
- assess each source for geographic coverage, update frequency, structured-data
  availability, authentication and rate limits, licensing and redistribution
  terms, reliability, language, and long-term operational suitability
- ingest only explicitly enabled sources through isolated provider adapters;
  do not scrape sites whose terms or technical controls prohibit it
- match reports to satellite detections using time, coordinates, settlement
  names, distance, and incident keywords while retaining the original source
  link and publication time
- show corroborating reports as context and calculate an explainable incident
  confidence; never present an automatically matched article as definitive
  emergency confirmation
- add deduplication, caching, request limits, safe URL validation, content-size
  limits, redacted logging, and tests before enabling network news enrichment

### Later

- evapotranspiration useful for irrigation logic
- surface solar radiation
- selected vegetation metrics where satellite resolution is meaningful

## Home Assistant Repairs

TerraLyra IGNIS creates one actionable Home Assistant repair notice for each upstream
provider whose credentials are rejected or which fails at least three
consecutive attempts, and also when no configured source geographically covers
one or more enabled monitored locations. A successful update or corrected
configuration removes the corresponding notice automatically. A short
transient failure does not create a repair notice, and healthy peer sources
continue independently.

## Important limitations

Satellite fire detection is **not an emergency warning service**. Cloud, viewing geometry, product latency, spatial resolution and algorithmic false positives/negatives can delay or prevent detection. Do not use this integration as the sole life-safety or property-protection warning system.

MTFRPPixel is currently an LSA SAF demonstration product, so its availability or format may change.

NASA FIRMS VIIRS and MODIS near-real-time data has its own latency, coverage, confidence and
false-positive limitations. Multi-source agreement strengthens the available
satellite evidence but does not prove that an emergency is occurring.

## Official Hungarian emergency notices (manual)

Since 0.18.0, **Developer Tools → Actions → TerraLyra IGNIS: Get official BM OKF
notices** returns current Hungarian emergency-notice titles, publication times,
original links and BM OKF attribution. No credentials or action fields are needed.
The action ID is `terralyra_ignis.get_official_reports` and it returns a response.

This is a manual discovery tool, not an automatic news layer on the map. Notices
can include traffic accidents and other non-fire events. They are not matched to
satellite incidents because the RSS feed does not provide coordinates. An empty
response does not mean no fires exist. Existing entities and automations are
unchanged.

Results are cached for five minutes; failures also impose a five-minute cooldown.
There is no background polling, incident-page scraping or new Repair notification.
See the [source review](docs/HU_OFFICIAL_REPORT_SOURCE_REVIEW.md) for limitations.

### Optional publication calendar (0.19.0)

The **Reports — BM OKF notices** calendar is disabled by default. To opt in, open
the IGNIS entity list, include disabled entities, select this calendar and enable
it. It will then appear in Home Assistant's Calendar view and refresh every 15
minutes. Disabling it stops its scheduled refreshes. It shares the manual
action's five-minute cache; no monitored-location data is sent to BM OKF.

Each entry contains BM OKF attribution and the original notice URL. The time is
the **publication time**, represented by a one-minute display slot, not the
incident's start or duration. This is a separate publication calendar, not the
satellite incident-history calendar. The archive includes non-fire emergencies, but
the calendar now shows only notices with explicit Hungarian fire-incident language
in the title or description. Firefighter mentions alone do not qualify. Weather
alerts, ordinary accidents and ambiguous notices are hidden, not deleted. An
accident notice explicitly describing a vehicle fire remains visible. This is a
conservative, local text rule: it may miss unusual wording, is not an official
classification, and does not confirm a satellite match. It includes building and
vehicle fires as well as vegetation fires; it is not a geographic filter. Publications
seen while fetching are now retained locally for 30 days from publication, up to
1000 URLs, across restarts. This is not a complete historical feed. Archived entries
remain readable during feed outages with live RSS health shown separately.
There is no automatic satellite association. No background collection starts
unless the calendar is enabled; manual discovery also archives fetched notices.

### Manual report matching review (0.19.0)

Use **Developer Tools → Actions → Review official report matches**
(`terralyra_ignis.review_official_report`). Select the IGNIS configuration and
an original BM OKF event URL from the current RSS response or local archive. Confirm the notice
describes a fire, then provide reviewed fire coordinates and assumed location
uncertainty. Optional event start/end values must include a timezone; otherwise
the action uses publication time. It returns candidate incident IDs, distances
and reasons without changing incidents, markers or notifications. Candidates also
include coordinates, actual first/last detection timestamps, providers, satellites
and a per-candidate review token. Detection timestamps are not ignition/extinction
times, and are not the calendar's one-minute display extension.

Extracted previous-day date hints require review and are never applied
automatically. This is not automatic news-to-fire matching. See the
[review instructions](docs/HU_OFFICIAL_REPORT_SOURCE_REVIEW.md) for limitations.

### Saving one manually reviewed link (0.21.0)

After inspecting a candidate, use `terralyra_ignis.save_official_report_link`.
Repeat the exact review inputs, select its `incident_id`, copy its `review_token`,
and explicitly set `confirm_association: true`. Save candidates individually;
the review action itself never saves them. Changed report content, candidate
metadata or review assumptions invalidate the token and require another review.

Links are **manual context, not official confirmation**. The heuristic `possible`
or `probable` assessment is preserved and is neither a probability nor proof.
Active links appear in both calendar descriptions without merging events, changing
timestamps, adding satellite sources, or affecting counts, confidence or alerts.
They are stored separately per IGNIS configuration, survive restarts and expire
no later than 30 days after publication (global cap: 1000 links; no silent eviction
to make room). A revised/missing report or missing/reused incident identity makes
the link inactive. A temporary missing source may become available again; the
original report fingerprint and incident first-seen time must still match.

Use `terralyra_ignis.list_official_report_links` with `config_entry_id` to inspect
saved provenance and status locally. Use `terralyra_ignis.remove_official_report_link`
with the configuration ID and returned `link_id` to undo one association, even if
the entry is temporarily unloaded. Removal never deletes the report or incident.
No live association is seeded automatically. See the
[manual-link test procedure](docs/MANUAL_REPORT_LINKS.md).

### Importing a saved publication

`terralyra_ignis.import_official_report` accepts an original BM OKF `url`, `title`,
timezone-aware `published_at` and optional plain-text `description` (4000 characters).
It writes only the local publication archive, labels the record `manual_import`,
and never changes satellite incidents. The original publication must be within
the last 30 days; do not substitute the import date. Actual RSS observations take
precedence over manual imports. Retention pruning occurs on archive access.
The [saved Egyek example](examples/egyek-report-import.yaml) preserves the September
9 publication, including its source attribution and original text. Import explicitly;
it is never seeded into installations automatically.

## Validation and release readiness

The repository includes automated GitHub Actions for:

- Python 3.14 syntax compilation and JSON validation
- Home Assistant Hassfest validation
- HACS repository validation
- CodeQL static analysis
- Bandit Python security analysis
- pip-audit dependency vulnerability checks
- repository secret-pattern scanning and weekly Dependabot updates

The repository bundles local normal- and high-DPI brand icons for Home Assistant
2026.3 and newer. The HACS `brands` check remains ignored until the same artwork
is accepted into the separate upstream `home-assistant/brands` repository. Each
stable integration version is published as a GitHub release for predictable
HACS installation and rollback.
